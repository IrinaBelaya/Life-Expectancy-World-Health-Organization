# Life-Expectancy-World-Health-Organization

## Summary: 
Life expectancy is simply defined as the number of years an individual can
expect to live. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) database, I performed a
linear regression, a multiple linear regression followed by the logistic regression to
formulate a hypothesis. After cleaning the dataset, the linear regression revealed that
all independent variables impact the dependent variable or life expectancy (Adj. Rsquared
= 0.814 and p=0.00). These findings led me to ask what determines life
expectancy and how it is changed worldwide. Further analysis made me question the
following:
1- How does life expectancy compare between developed and developing countries?
2 - What is life expectancy in Canada? How does Canada’s life expectancy compare to
other developed countries?
3 - What defines country status as “developed” / “developing”?
4 – Using health as percentage of Growth Domestic Product known as GDP, is Canada
fitting within developed countries?

I found a significant difference in life expectancy between the two populations - developed and developing countries (p<0.05). Life expectancy in Developed countries is 12 years higher on average and adult mortality in is twice lower (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population). More interestingly, BMI in Developed countries is higher, while the Polio and Diphtheria immunization level is almost the same in both Developed and Develiping countries (slightly higher in Developed). HIV/AIDS (deaths per 1 000 live births HIV/AIDS) is significantly higher in Developing countries. However, GPD is significantly higher in Developed countries. Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources - higher in Developed countries by 30% and schooling is higher in Developed countries by 27%. Finally, the models and predictions in our model can have some practical application such as risk assessment for insurance providers, actuarial analytics for marketing, overview of healthiness and so on and eventually impact on decision making process by the officials.
